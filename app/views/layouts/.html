    <h1>Welcome to Throwing Shapes Apparel</h1>

    <p>Throwing Shapes are an Irish T Shirt Design Duo.</p>

    <p>We design T-Shirts to Love in, Sweat in, Laugh in, Party in and Throw Shapes in.</p>

    <p>T-Shirts come in unisex sizes in Small, Medium, Large, XL, and XXL. They are all high quality 100% cotton. Each
        and every design is limited for extra exclusivity, to 25 T-Shirts (in various sizes) so that you know your
        T-Shirt is special</p>

    <p>We want our T Shirts to be worn by people who know how to live life to the full, giggle uncontrollably, love
        strangers, and dance until they fall over.</p>

    <p>And because WE love YOU (oh yes we do) we are offering you 20% off for the entire month of December (while stocks
        last)</p>

    <p>Plus, we want to share our passion for Life and for Dancing with all of you, so check out our videos and blog for
        music news, interviews with top DJs and exclusive competitions.</p>

    <p>Love</br>TS x</p>

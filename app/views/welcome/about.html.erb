  <h1>What is Street Heart all about?</h1>
  <p class="p-one">Our plan is to launch a web campaign called Street_Heart, aimed at raising funds for Focus Ireland. I'm sure I don't have to tell you that its a crazy time of year for everyone both financially and work-wise, and with the proposed increases in VAT and cuts to social protection, everyone has a lot on their minds. In the midst of all of this there are more and more families losing their homes and many people, 1 in 7 of them children, are facing down the prospect of spending Christmas sleeping rough or in sheltered accommodation.</p>
  <p class="p-two"><span class="img-position"><%= image_tag("Focus_Ireland_Breakdown.jpg") %><br/><em>Focus Ireland Funding Breakdown</em></span>With this in mind, we would like to work with street artists and graphic designers to design a series of grafs that will be applied to gifts and apparel and sold on our website. We're all working pro bono which means all proceeds will go to Focus Ireland. Focus Ireland is a registered charity making a real difference to the lives of people struggling to find accommodation. They provide shelter and food  as well as helping put preventative measures in place for people who are at risk of losing their home. You can see exactly where their funding goes <%= link_to "here", "http://www.focusireland.ie/index.php/who-we-are/annual-reports/how-we-spend-our-money" %>.</p>
  <p class="p-three">How can you help? We're looking for street artists and urban creatives to submit a design, doodle or even a block of text that we can apply to clothing and gifts which we'll sell on our website. We're also looking for a clothing and /or gifts manufacturer or supplier to provide us with material we can print on, as well as anyone involved in printing who'll apply the designs to the merchandise. </p>
  <p class="p-four">What are we doing? We'll be designing and developing the website, graphics, and back end of the website, as well as coordinating the artwork, contributors and fundraising. In the interest of transparency, we plan to publish our finances online as well as post stories of how how this funding is directly effecting the lives of the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
  <p class="p-five">Times are seriously tight, so whatever help you can give us will be hugely appreciated. It's worth mentioning that we plan to promote all contributors to this campaign on our website, our social media pages and in any press releases and media coverage we get.
